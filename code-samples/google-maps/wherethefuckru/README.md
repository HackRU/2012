## Introduction

This is a Google Maps application that enables you to search an address around Rutgers and get an estimate of how far away it is from a few bus stops. 

It's useful when you are searching for Off Campus Housing.

The [live version](http://vverma.net) is a little less clean but more feature rich (with some basic caching support).

This application uses the Google Maps Javascript API to get directions.

You should be able to view the application using any PHP webserver.
